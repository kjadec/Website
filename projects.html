                In this project, I worked with a group of students to design an
                Ultrasonic Range Finder utilizing many analog and digital
                electronic components, as well as a piezoelectric transducer!
                Some of these components include amplifiers, filters, 555 timers
                and counters. The circuit functionality was demonstrated
                utilizing NI multisim (the circuit design can be seen below).
                With extensive debugging using lab equipment such as
                oscilloscopes and wave form generators, the modular circuit was
                produced.

                For this project, I was able to design and produce a sequential
                logic circuit to cycle through my 9-digit student number. With
                logic optimization, simplifications were made and the circuit
                was simulated using NI multisim. The final deliverable was a
                functional circuit built with base-level electronics such as
                logic gates, JK flip-flops, and a 7-segment display!

                The "Stayin' Alive Driver Alertness Monitor" was designed and
                developed using a Raspberry Pi, pressure sensors, and a
                vibration motor! This device was developed with the intent to
                minimize driving incidents due to fatigue by having drivers wear
                an interactive device which was based on reaction time. The
                housing unit was modelled using Autodesk Inventor. The design
                was presented and demonstrated at a design expo!
